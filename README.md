# Neighborhood Map Project
This project is a map of the Las Vegas Strip for the Udacity Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree Program.  The Google Maps API is used to display a map with multiple markers corresponding to various hotels on the strip.  The app uses Knockout JS to handle the list of hotels, as well as the filtering function.  The Wikipedia API is also called to give additional information about markers once they are selected.

## Instructions
